# Splashtop Streamer for Arch (and Manjaro) Linux

Enables the installation of Splashtop Streamer on Arch-like operating systems. Uses the [official Ubuntu `deb`](https://support-splashtopbusiness.splashtop.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035513772-Download-Splashtop-Streamer-for-Linux) as data source.

Just a simple PKGBUILD derived from [debtap](https://github.com/helixarch/debtap)'s output. I am not putting it on AUR myself, because I do not plan on maintaining it.
